                    <h2>What is a vaccination?</h2>
                    <p>Vaccination is simple, safe and effective. It protects you against harmful dieases by building your body's natural defences to be more resistant against certain infections and makes your immune system stronger overall.</p>
                    <p>Vaccines cause your immune system to create antibodies by injecting weakened forms of the virus. This does not cause the disease or put you at risk.</p>
                    <p>There is a quick rundown of everything in this video:</p>

                    <h2 class="spacing">Why you should take a vaccine?</h2>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting the vaccine can lower the risk of getting Covid-19 and if everyone takes it, we can contain it to a certain extent</li>
                        <li>If you do end up getting it, it will help prevent illnesses and death</li>
                        <li>COVID-19 vaccines becomes less effective at preventing infection or severe illness over time so thats why booster shots should be taken</li>
                        <li>anyone above the age of 5 can take it</li>

                    <h3>Do NOT get it if:</h3>

                    <p>If you are allergic to the Vaccine, look for other vaccines that are not mRNA like Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s Janssen</p>
                    <p class="spacing">In the case that you get a severe allergic reaction which includes a rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat, or a generalized rash or hives, you need to be treated with epinephrine and should seek medical attention immediately.</p>
                    <h2>Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>All COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are ingredients found in many foodsâ€”fats, sugars, and salts. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). The COVID-19 mRNA teaches cells in the body how to create an effective immune response to the virus that causes COVID-19. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all the vaccine ingredients, just as it would discard any substance that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning.</p>
                    <p>All COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured with as few ingredients as possible and with very small amounts of each ingredient.</p>

                    <p>Pfizer-BioNTech has updated the formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The updated formulation has the same active ingredients as the previous formulation but uses different stabilizers (ingredients that help keep the vaccine molecules stable while the vaccine is manufactured, frozen, shipped, and stored). These changes allow for easier shipping and longer storage of vaccines at refrigerator temperatures. This will help improve access to vaccines for people who need them and will decrease waste.</p>
                    <p>The previous formulation for people ages 12 years and older is no longer being distributed, and once the doses of that formulation have been used, only the updated formulation will be available. Both formulations can be used interchangeably without any safety or effectiveness concerns. Check with your healthcare provider about which formulation they carry if you are concerned about any of the ingredients.</p>

                    <h2>Who should get the Vaccine?</h2>
                    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is recommended for people ages 18 years and older.</p>
                    <h3>Do NOT get it if:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>you have had a severe allergic reaction or have a diagnosed allergy to any ingredient in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</li>
                        <li>you had a severe allergic reaction after getting a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you are allergic to the Vaccine, look for other vaccines that are not mRNA like Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s Janssen</p>
                    <p class="spacing">In the case that you get a severe allergic reaction which includes a rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat, or a generalized rash or hives, you need to be treated with epinephrine and should seek medical attention immediately.</p>
                    <h2>Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Ingredients</h2>
                    <p>All COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. Nearly all the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are ingredients found in many foodsâ€”fats, sugars, and salts. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). The COVID-19 mRNA teaches cells in the body how to create an effective immune response to the virus that causes COVID-19. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all the vaccine ingredients, just as it would discard any substance that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning.</p>
                    <p>All COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured with as few ingredients as possible and with very small amounts of each ingredient. Each ingredient in the vaccine serves a specific purpose as seen in the table below.</p>

                    <h1>Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</h1>
                    <p>COVID-19 vaccination helps protect people from getting COVID-19. Some people have side effects from the vaccine, which are normal signs that their body is building protection. These side effects may affect their ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects, and allergic reactions are rare.</p>
                    <p>Adverse effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unusual following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination. If adverse effects occur, they generally happen within six weeks of receiving a vaccine dose. For this reason, during clinical trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collected data on each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines for a minimum of two months (eight weeks) after the final dose. CDC, FDA, and other federal agencies continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines even now that the vaccines are in use.</p>
                    <h2>Common Side Effects</h2>

                    <h2>After a Second Shot or a Booster Shot</h2>
                    <p>Side effects after the second shot may be more intense than the ones experienced after the first shot. These side effects are normal signs that the body is building protection and should go away within a few days.</p>
                    <p>So far, reactions reported after getting a booster shot are similar to those after the two-dose or single-dose primary shots. Fever, headache, fatigue, and pain at the injection site were the most commonly reported side effects, and overall, most side effects were mild to moderate. However, as with the two-dose or single-dose primary shots, serious side effects are rare but can occur.</p>
