                    <h1>What is a vaccination?</h1>
                    <p>Vaccination is simple, safe and effective. It protects you against harmful dieases by building your body's natural defences to be more resistant against certain infections and makes your immune system stronger overall.</p>
                    <p>Vaccines cause your immune system to create antibodies by injecting weakened forms of the virus. This does not cause the disease or put you at risk.</p>
                    <p>There is a quick rundown of everything in this video:</p>

                    <h1>Why you should take a vaccine?</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting the vaccine can lower the risk of getting Covid-19 and if everyone takes it, we can contain it to a certain extent</li>
                        <li>If you do end up getting it, it will help prevent illnesses and death</li>
                        <li>COVID-19 vaccines becomes less effective at preventing infection or severe illness over time so thats why booster shots should be taken</li>
                        <li>anyone above the age of 5 can take it</li>

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA).

This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all the vaccine ingredients, just as it would discard any substance that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning.</p>
                        <p>All COVID-19 vaccines are manufactured with as few ingredients as possible and with very small amounts of each ingredient. Each ingredient in the vaccine serves a specific purpose as seen in the table below.</p>

                    <h1>Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</h1>
                    <p>COVID-19 vaccination helps protect people from getting COVID-19. Some people have side effects from the vaccine, which are normal signs that their body is building protection. These side effects may affect their ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects, and allergic reactions are rare.</p>
                    <p>Adverse effects that could cause a long-term health problem are extremely unusual following any vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccination. If adverse effects occur, they generally happen within six weeks of receiving a vaccine dose. For this reason, during clinical trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collected data on each of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines for a minimum of two months (eight weeks) after the final dose. CDC, FDA, and other federal agencies continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines even now that the vaccines are in use.</p>

                    <p>Side effects after the second shot may be more intense than the ones experienced after the first shot. These side effects are normal signs that the body is building protection and should go away within a few days.</p>
                    <p>So far, reactions reported after getting a booster shot are similar to those after the two-dose or single-dose primary shots. Fever, headache, fatigue, and pain at the injection site were the most commonly reported side effects, and overall, most side effects were mild to moderate. However, as with the two-dose or single-dose primary shots, serious side effects are rare but can occur.</p>
